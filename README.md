# Yusuf Akyol

I'm Yusuf, a full-stack web developer working mainly with ASP.NET Core on the backend and React with Tailwind CSS on the frontend. I enjoy building real-world projects that are functional, scalable, and easy to manage — especially admin panels, CMS platforms, and multilingual business websites.

I specialize in:
- ASP.NET Core & Entity Framework
- SQL Server & database-driven systems
- Admin panel and CMS development
- Tailwind CSS & responsive frontend design
- RESTful APIs and full-stack architecture

Since 2020, I’ve been working independently on web projects, building and delivering complete solutions from backend logic to frontend interfaces. In 2024, I also started working with Reta on a project-based agreement.

I'm always trying to improve what I build and how I build it. You can reach me at ysfkyl2000@gmail.com if you'd like to connect.
